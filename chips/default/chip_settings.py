    This will be rewritten, before I was talking about each layer individually (attention, feed forward, etc)
    Moving toward an attention layer focused process with H, Q, K, V, A similar to DRµGS
    Support for H, Q, K, V, A below, after this initial section for individual layers that I'm still supporting cause it has a good CFG setting
    """
    
    """
    Layer count is head_layer + 1
    layer_settings indices range from 0 to head_layer
    layer_settings[last_kv_layer - 1] is the last layer that will influence the preprocessed cache (because of the order this is done)
    layer_settings[head_layer] is the last index and will output logits rather than a hidden state
    
    How the CFG works:
    1. The difference between the tensors for negative prompt - positive prompt is found
    2. That difference is multiplied by the weight in LayerSettings
    3. That difference is subtracted from the tensors (steering positive away from negative by their difference)
    The larger the weight, the more intense of an effect
    
    
    
    There is also support for a custom CFG function instead of the default above, by setting cfg_func in any layer you want to override
    LayerSettings(cfg_func=YourFuncionHere)
    The function will be called with these parameters: new_tensors = cfg_func(tensor, settings, hackingchip)
      Tensor will be the full block of positive and negative tensors
      Settings will be the respective settings object (layer or QKV settings)
      Hackingchip is included for extra info, such as hackingchip.prompt.numpos, hackingchip.prompt.numneg, and hackingchip.prompt.negend
    You must return the new full tensors (same shape as input tensors) after your modification
    
    For an example of a custom cfg_func, see cfg_repulsor below
